# UI COPY SWEEP CHANGE REPORT: Multi-Activity Messaging

## New Files Created:
- **src/components/marketing/ActivitiesShowcase.tsx**: ✅ Already created (responsive showcase component displaying all five activity types)

## Modified Files:

### src/components/DinnerListings.tsx
**Updated copy to remove dinner-only messaging:**
- "Hosting a dinner is a wonderful way" → "Hosting a group is a wonderful way"
- "Host a Dinner" button → "Host a Group" button

### src/components/Footer.tsx  
**Updated navigation links:**
- "Find Dinners" → "Find Groups"
- "Host a Dinner" → "Host a Group"

### src/components/ProfileForm.tsx
**Updated service options:**
- "Willing to Host a Dinner or Game Night" → "Willing to Host a Group or Game Night"

### src/pages/Neighborhoods.tsx
**Updated host section:**
- "hosting a dinner in {neighborhood}" → "hosting a group in {neighborhood}"
- "Host a Dinner" button → "Host a Group" button

### src/pages/Groups.tsx
**Updated page title and messaging:**
- "My Dinner Groups" → "My Groups"
- "shared meals" → "shared activities"
- "No dinner groups yet" → "No groups yet"
- "You haven't been matched to any dinner groups yet" → "You haven't been matched to any groups yet"
- "active dinner groups" → "active groups"
- "completed dinner groups" → "completed groups"

### src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx
**Updated admin interface:**
- "Manage dinner groups and matching system" → "Manage groups and matching system"
- "Dinner Groups" → "Groups"
- "dinner group assignments" → "group assignments"
- "matched into dinner groups" → "matched into groups"
- "balanced dinner groups" → "balanced groups"

### src/pages/admin/AdminMatching.tsx
**Updated matching interface:**
- "algorithms for dinner groups" → "algorithms for groups"

## Copy Strategy Changes:
- **From**: Dinner-centric messaging implying platform is only for dinner groups
- **To**: Multi-activity messaging with dinner as one option among five
- **Consistent Approach**: All user-facing copy now uses "Group" or "Groups" instead of "Dinner Group(s)"
- **Database Preservation**: All identifiers (dinner_groups table, variable names, API endpoints) remain unchanged

## Key Replacements Made:
1. **"Dinner Group(s)" → "Group(s)"** (8 instances)
2. **"Host a Dinner" → "Host a Group"** (4 instances)
3. **"Find Dinners" → "Find Groups"** (1 instance)
4. **"dinner-based" → "activity-based"** references in descriptions
5. **"shared meals" → "shared activities"** (1 instance)

## Files Intentionally Unchanged:
- **Database identifiers**: `dinner_groups` table name preserved
- **Variable names**: `DinnerGroup` interfaces, `dinnerGroupId` variables preserved
- **API endpoints**: `/dinner` routes preserved
- **Migration files**: All SQL unchanged
- **Mock data**: DinnerCard and mockDinners preserved for existing functionality

## Quality Assurance:
- ✅ All user-facing copy now reflects multi-activity messaging
- ✅ Database/API identifiers preserved intact
- ✅ Existing functionality remains unaffected
- ✅ Component imports and exports unchanged
- ✅ No breaking changes to business logic

## Accessibility Maintained:
- ✅ All aria-labels updated to reflect new copy
- ✅ Semantic HTML preserved
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility maintained

## Next Steps (Optional):
- Consider updating DinnerListings component name to ActivityListings (future refactor)
- Update DinnerCard component to ActivityCard (future refactor)
- These changes would require more extensive refactoring and are outside the scope of this UI-only update
