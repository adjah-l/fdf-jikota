# MARKETING COPY CHANGE REPORT: Multi-Activity Messaging

## New Files Created:
- **src/components/marketing/ActivitiesShowcase.tsx**: Responsive showcase component displaying all five activity types with descriptions and CTA buttons

## Modified Files:

### src/components/Hero.tsx
**Updated copy to be multi-activity focused:**
- "shared meals" → "shared activities" 
- "sharing dinner with your neighbors" → "gatherings that bring neighbors together—dinner is one way to start"
- "Host a Dinner" button → "Host a Group" button
- "Dinners Hosted" stat → "Groups Hosted" stat

### src/pages/HomeNew.tsx  
**Added ActivitiesShowcase component:**
- Imported and integrated ActivitiesShowcase component
- New section shows all five activity types instead of dinner-only messaging

### src/pages/UseCases.tsx
**Updated feature lists to be activity-agnostic:**
- "Dinner groups that build lasting relationships" → "Groups that build lasting relationships"
- "5C dinner groups by neighborhood zones" → "Activity-based groups by neighborhood zones"  
- "Networking dinner groups" → "Professional networking groups"

### src/pages/ForOrganizations.tsx
**Standardized activity examples across all organization types:**
- Churches: Updated features to show all five activities: "Dinner", "Prayer / Bible Study", "Working Out", "Watch Sporting Events", "Flexible"
- HOAs & Communities: Same five activities 
- Professional Organizations: Same five activities

## Copy Strategy Changes:
- **From**: Dinner-centric messaging implying platform is only for dinner groups
- **To**: Multi-activity messaging with dinner as the friendly default example among five options
- **Consistent Activity List**: Dinner, Prayer / Bible Study, Working Out, Watch Sporting Events, Flexible
- **Language Shift**: "Dinner Group" → "Group", "dinner-based" → "activity-based"

## UI/UX Improvements:
- New ActivitiesShowcase is fully responsive (1 column mobile → 5 columns desktop)
- Each activity card uses semantic HTML (`<article>`) with proper accessibility labels
- Icons and descriptions provide clear visual differentiation between activity types
- CTAs route appropriately based on user authentication status

## Database/Backend Preservation:
- ✅ No changes to database tables, column names, or API identifiers
- ✅ Legacy `dinner_groups` table and references remain untouched
- ✅ Only UI/marketing copy was modified per DEV-ADjah standard

## Quality Assurance:
- All activity examples now consistently use the refined five-activity list
- Marketing pages no longer imply dinner-only functionality
- Existing users and data remain unaffected
- Copy maintains dinner as a welcoming default while showcasing variety
