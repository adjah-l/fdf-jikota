# CHANGE REPORT: Activity Groups Feature Implementation

## New Files Created:
- **src/hooks/useActivityGroups.ts**: Data hooks for activity groups with fallback to dinner groups
- **src/app/admin/pages/Groups.tsx**: Admin groups listing page with legacy dinner group support
- **src/app/admin/pages/GroupForm.tsx**: Admin group create/edit form with navigation
- **src/components/ActivityPreferenceModal.tsx**: Onboarding modal for activity preferences
- **src/hooks/useMyGroup.ts**: Hook for getting current user's group with fallback

## Modified Files:
- **src/App.tsx**: Added admin routes for groups management (`/admin2/groups/*`)
- **src/app/member/pages/Group.tsx**: Updated to use activity labels and new data hooks

## Database Changes:
- **Added SQL migration**: `profiles.preferred_activity_type` column (enum type)

## Existing Files (Already Implemented):
- **src/lib/activityTypes.ts**: ✅ Already exists with required constants
- **src/lib/schemas.ts**: ✅ Contains activityGroupSchema validation  
- **src/components/ActivityTypeSelector.tsx**: ✅ Refined activity selector component
- **src/components/admin/ActivityGroupForm.tsx**: ✅ Form component for group creation/editing

## New Admin Routes Added:
- `/admin2/groups` → Groups listing page
- `/admin2/groups/new` → Group creation form
- `/admin2/groups/:id/edit` → Group editing form

## Fallback Strategy:
All new UI components safely fallback to dinner_groups data when activity_groups are empty, ensuring non-destructive operation. Legacy data is marked with `_fallback: true` and shows "legacy" badges in admin.

## Activity Types Standardized:
- Dinner, Prayer/Bible Study, Working Out, Watch Sporting Events, Flexible
- Default: Dinner
- Language updated from "Dinner Group" to "Group" or "${ActivityType} Group"

## Features Completed:
✅ Activity types constants and validation  
✅ Data hooks with safe fallback  
✅ Admin group management UI  
✅ Member group page updates  
✅ Database schema extension  
✅ Onboarding preferences modal  
✅ Non-destructive implementation  

## Security Notes:
The migration completed successfully. Existing security warnings are from previous migrations and not related to this implementation.

## Next Steps (For User):
The feature is ready to use. Access admin group management at `/admin2/groups` when the `enableAdminShell` flag is enabled.
